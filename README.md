In this project, we are to identify users who have logged into a product on three separate days in at least one seven-day period as 'adopted users', and which factors predict future user adoption(the indicators of an adopted user).  
A user table ("takehome_users") with data on 12,000 users who signed up for the product in the last two years.  
A usage summary table ("takehome_user_engagement") that has a row for each day that a user logged into the product.
